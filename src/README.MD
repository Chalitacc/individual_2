# Indivdual Assignment 2



## Project Description
This is my Second assignment where i chose to make a grid template with my favorite handball team. I chose this as i always liked the team and i tried my best to integrate it. I took inspiration from their own site from the color layout and used the information about the members from there. Here is the link to their website: https://www.handball.no/regioner/nhf-sentralt/kampaktivitet/landslag/handballjentene/profiler/. When i did this i forgot to use git as we havent started learning about it yet. therefore there are only few commits here. 

## Navigation 
When entering the page you will see the the members right away and you can scroll down to see the profile of the different players and it is sectioned to their different positions too.
